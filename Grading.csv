"Data exploration:
Scope","Some discussion of the data is provided,
but it is very limited and not particularly relevant to the primary task.","Considerable discussion of the data is provided.  
Much of it is relevant, but several key task-relevant aspects remain unaddressed.","Discussion is quite thorough, and clearly connected to the main project objectives.   
Some key task-relevant aspects remain unaddressed.","Discussion is very thorough.  All aspects of the data that are relevant
 to the assignment/Project objectives are carefully addressed."
"Data Exploration:
Visualization","Some data visualizations are shown, 
but they do not provide much insight into the data.  
Figures are not well tailored to the project tasks.","Data visualization provides some insight into the data.  
Many figures are not well tailored to the project tasks.","Fairly thorough data visualization is presented, providing considerable insight.  
The Figures are mostly well-tailored to the project tasks.","Figures and tables are highly insightful, 
and are carefully tailored to the project tasks."
"Data Analysis: 
Data processing",There are several major issues with the data processing and variable handling. The issues invalidate one or more major components of the analysis.,"Data processing is acceptable, but there are several significant issues with subsetting, handling of missing values, and/or categorical variables.  ","Data is largely properly processed.  There are some issues, but the issues have only a minor impact on the interpretation or validity of the models/findings.","Data is carefully processed and subsetted in accordance with best-practices 
for each task.  Missing values and categorical variables are handled appropriately."
"Data Analysis: 
Modeling","Considerable issues in implementation or interpretation, AND/OR very few  methods are considered AND/OR several chosen methods are inappropriate.","There are notable issues in implementation or interpretation.  
The methods chosen are OK, but better options could have been considered.  ","There are minor issues in implementation or in interpretation that have only limited 
impact on the findings AND/OR some potentially relevant methods aren’t used.","Methods are well motivated, correctly implemented, and, 
to the extent appropriate, span the range of methods discussed in class.  "
"Data Analysis: 
Validation",There were major issues in how the models were validated.,"There are some issues with model validation, some of which may have 
resulted in misleading performance assessments.","There are minor issues with model validation, but the issues 
are unlikely to result in misleading performance assessments.","Cross-validation and/or held-out test sets are used in accordance 
with best practices to assess model performance."
"Data Analysis: 
Performance metrics",Performance metrics considered have little connection to the project objectives. ,"Performance metrics are reasonable, but ignore important costs and trade-offs 
that are central to the project objective.  ","Performance metrics are relevant to the project objectives, 
but may not entirely reflect the key costs and trade-offs in the problem.",Performance metrics are carefully tailored to the project objectives.
"Findings: 
Objectives","Project objectives are not met. One or more of the questions 
posed in the project description is not meaningfully addressed.","Several project objectives are met, and all questions posed in the project 
description are addressed in some meaningful way.","Project objectives are largely met, and the findings presented address almost all aspects f the questions posed in the project description.","All project objectives are fully met, and the findings presented clearly 
address every question posed in the project description."
"Findings: 
Overall","Client would have considerable concerns about whether the technical 
results are relevant for practice, and/or how to interpret the results.","Some findings are presented in terms that may be difficult for the client to understand. Client may be confused about what certain findings mean in practical terms, and/or whether they are relevant for practice.","Findings are presented largely in context-appropriate terms, 
but some gap remains between the findings and the practical problem context.  
Client may have minor concerns regarding relevance of findings.","Findings are clearly presented in context-appropriate terms with excellent 
supporting output. The client would likely be extremely pleased with the results."
